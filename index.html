           <h1>Polar bears</h1> 
            Polar bears have black skin covered in transparent, pigment-free hair. The hair scatters and reflects light, making polar bears appear white.
            Polar bears are the only bear species to be considered marine mammals because they spend most of their lives on the Arctic Ocean's sea ice. 
            Polar bears have white fur that helps them blend into their environment, but their skin is actually black. 
            Polar bears can swim up to 6 miles per hour and swim for long distances without rest. 
            Polar bears typically kill and eat prey every four to five days, but their hunts are rarely successful. 
            Polar bears have evolved one of the longest fasting periods of any animal because their habitat vanishes for a few months every year. </p>
